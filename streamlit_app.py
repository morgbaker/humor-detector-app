        DistilBERT is a smaller, faster, and lighter version of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). 
        Developed by Hugging Face, it retains **97% of BERT's language understanding** while being **60% faster** and reducing the model size by **40%**. 
        This efficiency makes DistilBERT particularly suitable for applications where computational resources are limited or where quick responses are essential, such as:

        - **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding the sentiment conveyed in text data.

    st.write("""
        This model has been **fine-tuned on a joke/no-joke dataset** to effectively detect humor in text. By leveraging the power of DistilBERT, the humor detection model can analyze linguistic patterns, context, and sentiment to discern whether a given piece of text is humorous or not.

    st.write("### Limitations and Things to Keep in Mind")
    st.write("""
        While DistilBERT is powerful, there are several limitations to consider when using this model for humor classification:
        
        - **Contextual Understanding**: Humor is often context-dependent, and the model may struggle to capture nuanced cultural references or context-specific humor.
        
        - **Subjectivity**: Humor is inherently subjective; what one person finds funny, another may not. The model's training data may not cover all variations of humor, leading to potential misclassifications.
        
        - **Limited Dataset**: The effectiveness of the model depends on the quality and diversity of the dataset it was fine-tuned on. This means the model may not generalize well to new or different types of humor.
        
        - **Language Nuances**: Sarcasm, irony, and wordplay can be particularly challenging for AI models to interpret correctly. The model may not always accurately identify these forms of humor.
